Script:

Topic : Life on Planets .
The narrator is in search for her friend Jack. She travels to planets in her spaceship . She first lands on Mars but finds the place lonely and dull.
Couldn't find jack there. Then she sees Earth . She finds earth's terrain and environment very beautiful . While roaming on Earth she finds Jack one day, who
was happily playing around in the garden .



Steps followed:
We made a blender object first (a
man).Then we started making our scenes in unity by adding 3D objects (liketerrain,sphere etc.),adding textures and lighting.Then we animated them
. We also wrote some scripts for animating objects . We used some objects from the unity asset store and one character we modelled using blender.Then we added
sounds. And took screencast of all the scenes . While taking screencast we also recorded narration. Finally with video editing and combining
softwares we made the final video .
